This repo will be dedicated to the exploration of the relationship between time of production in a NHL draft eligible player's draft year, and movement up and down the draft board.

## Juraj Slafkovsky

In the 2022 draft the Montreal Canadiens, hosts of the draft and selecting 1st overall for the first time in their franchise history, selected Juraj Slafkovsky and shocked the hockey world. The Finnish player shot up through the ranks throughout the season to put his name in contention for the vaunted 1st overall selection.

Slafkovsky had two major moments in his draft year: his Olympic games showing, and the world championship at the end of the year.  The two tournaments - notorious for being big moments and catching all the eyes of the scouting world, vaunted Slafkovsky into consideration for the 1st overall selection.  Below is a look at his point production with a rolling 5-game average outlook:

Slafkovsky's league play, however, certainly didn't look the part of a typical 1st overall pick.  Using NHLe, a scoring standardization metric that uses weighting coefficients to comparing production across the non-NHL leagues, Slafkovsky was far out-paced by the projected 1st overall pick Shane Wright.
